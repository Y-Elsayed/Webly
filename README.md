# 🌐 Webly — Give Your Website a Voice

**Webly** is a modular, GenAI-powered web crawling and knowledge extraction framework. It transforms any website into a structured, searchable knowledge base — enabling intelligent search, chatbots, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

## 🚀 What Can Webly Do?

- 🔎 **Crawl entire websites** and intelligently extract content  
- 🧠 **Summarize and embed** content using LLMs or plug-in custom processors  
- 🧷 **Store semantic data** in JSONL or vector databases (e.g. FAISS, Qdrant)  
- 🤖 **Enable chatbots** and AI-powered search over any site  
- 🕸️ **Generate a full site graph** to analyze structure and interlinking

## 💡 Why Webly?

Most websites are built for humans — not machines. Webly changes that by turning static HTML into structured knowledge:

- Build **internal site search** that actually works  
- Power **AI assistants and chatbots** on your data  
- Enhance **RAG pipelines** with high-quality domain-specific chunks  
- Conduct **semantic audits** of content  
- Index and preserve **legacy web archives**

Whether you're building a smart FAQ bot or a semantic search engine over documentation, Webly gives you the tooling to make it happen — fast.

## ⚙️ Key Features

-  **Modular pipeline** with clear separation of crawling, extraction, summarization, embedding, and storage  
-  **Built on WebCreeper**, a custom-designed, extensible web crawling framework  
- **Pluggable architecture**: use your own chunker, summarizer, embedder, or vector DB  
-  **CLI-ready and interactive mode** — start chatting with any website in minutes  
-  **Debug output and summary logs** for easy traceability

## 🔧 How It Works (Overview)

1. **Crawl** the site using WebCreeper (depth-first or full-site)  
2. **Extract and chunk** the HTML with a text processor (e.g. Trafilatura)  
3. **Summarize** content using a language model (optional)  
4. **Embed** chunks into vector representations  
5. **Store** vectors in a FAISS index  
6. **Query**: Embed a user question, retrieve top matches, and respond using LLM + context

## 📦 Setup

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

4. Create a config file (`config.json`) like:

```json
{
  "start_url": "https://example.com",
  "allowed_domains": ["example.com"],
  "output_dir": "./out_example",
  "index_dir": "./out_example/index",
  "results_file": "results.jsonl",
  "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "chat_model": "gpt-4o-mini"
}
```

5. Run Webly:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Example Use Case

Let’s say you want to turn your university's website into a chatbot. Simply point Webly to the homepage and it will:

- Crawl and map the site  
- Summarize academic programs, admissions, and contact pages  
- Index that knowledge into a vector database  
- Let users ask questions like “What majors does the university offer?” and get accurate, real-time answers.

## 🛠️ Extending Webly

Want to plug in your own LLM, switch to Qdrant, or change the extractor?

Every major component is pluggable:

```python
# Swap this in:
from my_custom.chunker import MyChunker
TextChunker() → MyChunker()
```
