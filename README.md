# 🌐 Webly : Give Your Website a Voice

**Webly** is a modular, GenAI-powered web crawling and knowledge extraction framework. It crawls any website, understands its content using LLMs, and converts it into structured, searchable, and embeddable data — enabling intelligent search, chatbots, or RAG pipelines.

> _"Webly makes it feel like the website itself is answering your questions."_

## Why Webly?

Most websites are made for humans, not machines. Webly transforms static HTML content into structured, intelligent knowledge that can be used in:

- Internal search systems  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines  
- AI assistants / chatbots  
- Site analytics and audits  
- Semantic indexing of legacy content
